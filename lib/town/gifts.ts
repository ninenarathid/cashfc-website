 * What a rank of a line of work gives (the owner, 2026-10-06: "อยากทำให้มี progression และ ฉายา ได้ไอเทม เหมือนกับที่
 * ขนน้ำทำได้ด้วย"), and what somebody wears of it. Pure: no clock, no chance, no network.
 *
 * His rulings, of that day:
 * - a gift is **bound to whoever earned it** and is in no slot of the bag ("ผูกกับตัวทั้งหมด ไม่นับรวมใน ช่องเก็บของ");
 *   the well's yoke, cart and great yoke are the exception, things of the bag that are lent already, and stay the
 *   well's own book's to give (lib/town/well);
 * - **two charms at a time** ("ช่องเครื่องราง 2 ช่อง"), one familiar (none is built yet), changed as often as one
 *   likes ("อิสระ"). Twelve charms and two places: one chooses by what one is about to do;
 * - nothing says what a rank will give until it is reached: the page shows a gift only once it can be taken.
 *
 * The first round is the first rank of every line: six charms (the well's first is its yoke). The forest's was a
 * vine basket that made its games kinder until he asked for a light in its place (the basket's picture is still in
 * the icons' sheet, used by nothing). What each does is a
 * number of this file (`CHARMS`); where it is the database that judges (the strike's moment, the stamina of work in
 * somebody else's bed) the same number is in the catalog's row and the rule is written again there (v151).
 * **Every number here is mine, not the owner's.**
