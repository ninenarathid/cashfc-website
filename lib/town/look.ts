/**
 * What a Cash Town avatar looks like: a pixel character of one of the game's
 * races, chosen in the wardrobe and drawn by lib/town/pixeldoll.
 *
 * Every choice is an index into a fixed list, so a look travels as eight
 * characters ("5" and one base-36 digit per field) inside the moves the room
 * already sends, and a look from another browser can be checked field by field
 * before anything is drawn from it. Colours come from curated palettes rather
 * than a picker: each is kept in a lightness band where the art's shading
 * survives the recolour.
 *
 * Each race has its own hairstyles (the game's character creator's own, each
 * gender its own list, in the creator's order) and its own skins; the
 * Lalafell's are written here, the other races' come from races.json (built
 * by the fc-cash-town skill's scripts/pixel/race-data.mjs from the research
 * on each race). Looks written before races (version "4", and "3", "2", "1"
 * before that) are Lalafell, keeping their gender and colours, taking the
 * nearest hairstyle, the skin as drawn and round eyes.
 *
 * Pure, so it can be tested without a browser.
