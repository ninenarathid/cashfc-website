/**
 * **The village's farm book** (the owner, 2026-11-07: "ช่วยทำ สมุดปลูกผักให้หน่อย มีข้อมูลผักทั้งหมด รายละเอียดเฉพาะที่ค้นพบแล้ว
 * รวมถึง คู่ผักด้วย ไม่งั้นคนเล่นหากันไม่เจอ"; his choices: found by anybody in the village counts, as the books of fish and
 * insects; a page not found yet shows its shape in shadow and one of its parents).
 *
 * Every crop has a page. One the uncle sells (never a crossing's child) is open from the start. A crossing's child (the
 * garden's hybrids, the helper plants a pollinator's sky decides, their mist forms) opens once somebody in the village has
 * found it: v322's `public.town_garden_book`, and a member's own `gardenBook` while that is not read yet. A page that is
 * shut tells one parent only; a parent's page tells the crossings whose child is open, and how many are still to find, never
 * the other parent of one not found (or a shut page's hint and a parent's page together would give the whole pair).
