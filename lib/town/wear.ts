 * หมวก เครื่องประดับ ที่ผู้เล่นใส่ได้ มาอย่างละ 5 ชิ้น ขอของ basic หาได้ง่ายๆในเกมก่อน"): everyday things of the town's
 * lines, a trial of how wearing things works in the game. Their pictures are the atlas's (`outfits`, `wear`), built
 * from prompts/doll2/items.json by build-pixel-atlas.mjs --doll2: an id here is its id there.
 *
 * **Everything is had from the game** (the owner, 2026-10-17: "ขอแต่งกายได้มาจากในเกมทั้งหมด ชุดอาชีพหาได้จาก rank 3 ในเกม
 * ให้มาพร้อม เครื่องราง"): a line's outfit comes at its rank 3, with that rank's gift, and so does its hat. The rest, on
 * his word the same day: round glasses from the uncle's shop, sunglasses from the bat merchant (not built yet), the
 * flower clip a 0.1% chance with each helpers' point. `from`: where it comes from; the starter and nothing worn are
 * everybody's. What is bought or dropped is had once the database says so (not built yet: only the TEST switch has it).
 *
 * Forty-six more (v277; the owner, 2026-10-17: "ทำ 46 ชิ้นก่อน", of the list both AIs made): made at the workbench
 * (lib/town/wear-items), four more on the uncle's shelf, the sixth ranks of five lines, and chances with a line's
 * points narrowed by the deed, the thing, the hour or the rain (`Drop`). The rarest are before dawn (lib/town/bands,
 * the owner's rule of 2026-10-15): the mushroom cap and the beetle at 03–05, the sailor's stripes at 05–07. Everybody who
 * helped build the bridge has the builder's things already (v277 gives them from the deeds), and anybody may have
 * them by helping somebody else's work; the chances and the prices are mine, not answered.
 *
 * A look writes each slot as an index into its list (lib/town/look), so only ever add at the end. The first of every
 * list but the outfits is nothing worn. Pure.
