/**
 * Cooking and serving, as rules (the owner, 2026-10-03, and the bowls of 2026-10-04).
 *
 * - **A recipe is never told** ("เราจะไม่บอกสูตรอาหาร จะแค่ใบ้ไว้ในเกม"): things are
 *   picked by hand and put together ("ทำอาหาร ต้องเลือก วัตถุดิบเอง ไม่ใช่เลือกเป้น
 *   สูตร"), and if they are exactly a dish's, with its cookware in its cooks'
 *   hands, they become it. Whoever makes a dish first has found its recipe.
 * - **The wrong things make an odd dish** ("ถ้าเลือกผิดจะได้อาหารแปลกๆ มา กินได้ แต่ไม่ได้
 *   เพิ่ม stamina เยอะ และไม่มี buff"): cooked by somebody who holds cookware,
 *   things that are no recipe's (the wrong ones, the wrong amounts, the wrong
 *   cookware, too few cooks) come out as a pot of something that can be eaten
 *   and is good for little. Nothing says which of those it was: that is what
 *   makes cooking hard ("ทำเพื่อให้การทำอาหารยากขึ้น"), and what there is to ask one
 *   another about. Only somebody who has made the thing before is told when
 *   the cooks or the cookware are missing, and wastes nothing. Put together
 *   with bare hands, things that make nothing are lost, and leave a little
 *   compost.
 * - **But the way can be felt for** ("ถึงเราจะทำให้ทำอาหารยาก และต้องเดา วัตถุดิบ แต่ก็ยังต้องทำให้
 *   ผู้เล่นยังพอ คลำทางไปเจอวิธีทำที่ถูกต้องได้"): what comes of the wrong things has a
 *   taste, which says how near they were to making something (`tasteOf`):
 *   nothing like anything, some of it right, one thing off, the right things
 *   in the wrong amounts, everything right but the way it was cooked. It costs
 *   what was put in, each time. And a recipe somebody keeps missing by its
 *   last thing alone, the one a found recipe does not name, comes to say what
 *   that thing looks like and then to show its shadow, after so many tries
 *   (`CLUES`, lib/town/clues).
 * - **A dish takes its cookware, each piece in a cook's hand**, and as many
 *   cooks standing at the yard's places as its recipe says ("สูตรอาหารที่ต้องใช้
 *   มากกว่า 1 เครื่องมือ (ใช้หลายคนช่วยกันทำ)"). The things come from the bag of
 *   whoever begins it.
 * - **What is cooked comes as a big pot of it** ("อาหารถ้าทำเสร็จแล้ว จะได้มาเป็นหม้อ
 *   ใหญ่ๆ"), the yard's own: the cook brings none ("ช่วยเอาเงื่อนไข หม้อเปล่าในการทำอาหาร
 *   ออกไปเลย ดูจะยุ่งยากเกินไป"), only a free slot in the bag for it. The pot can
 *   be set down on an empty spot for others to ladle from, each with a bowl of
 *   their own ("คนทำสามารถวางไว้บนที่ว่างๆ ให้คนอื่นมาตักได้ (คนอื่นต้องมีถ้วย)").
 * - **A helping goes into a bowl, and the bowl goes with it** (the owner,
 *   2026-10-04: "ตอนตักใส่ถ้วย ถ้วยต้องหายไปด้วย ต้องกินหมดก่อนถ้วยค่อยกลับมา"): ladling takes
 *   a bowl out of the bag and puts the helping there instead; the bowl is back
 *   when the helping has been eaten (lib/town/stamina). Sold, or brought to the
 *   uncle, a helping goes bowl and all.
 * - **A pot whose last helping is ladled out is gone** ("หม้อสกปรก ตัดออกเลย พอตักครบ
 *   ออกหายออกจากพื้นไปเลย"): it was the yard's. There is no dirty pot and no washing
 *   up (there was, for a day).
 * - **Other things are made the same way** (lib/town/items' MAKES): a sauce, a
 *   paste, a basket. They come as themselves, into the bag, and need no pot
 *   to hold them. What is put together by hand needs no cookware at all.
 *
 * Pure, like the rest: each function is given what it needs and gives back
 * new things.
